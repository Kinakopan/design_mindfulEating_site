                ー　Help Local Economy
                The Vancouver Farmers Market isn't just a great place to buy fresh, tasty food from local farmers. It also helps the local and regional economy by giving more than $15 million in direct and indirect benefits. People who buy food at our markets help 280 small-scale BC farmers, as well. Each year, we keep 4,000 acres of local farmland in use for growing food.

                ー　Locations
